#Purpose For This Project

This Application was developed with the guidance of Codecademys Full Stack Course.  The goal of this Application was to use stateful and stateless components to render a contacts page that new contacts could be appended to and an appointments page that could create appointments from the contacts page using state.  In the actual lesson, the react router is depreciated to version 4.0 which I initially utilized through their learning module, but opted to switch to learning react router v6.0 to obtain a bit more real world application.

I also, applied some of my own logic to prevent duplicate appointments and contacts from being appended into the list.  

##Things to consider adding post 12/15:
An automatic removal of appointments an hour after their appointment time, to prevent continuous adding of appointments.
  Would like utilize a useEffect hook to do it upon render with time being a second argument to the function as it is ever changing.
  
 Secondly:
  would consider manual removal of contact with some event listener function and add a button for removal. 
  
 Thirdly, consider merging the appointment list and app appointments to have a dropdown menu based on a state with an up and down arrow To make it a bit cleaner.
 
 
Overall pleased with this project as my understanding of component state and the purpose of hooks was clarified a bit better.  


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
